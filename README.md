## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable data pipeline that extracts, processes, and loads New York Taxi Trip data from the year 2019 into a data warehouse. The pipeline should be robust, handling large datasets efficiently and ensuring reliable data processing and loading for further analysis.

Data Extraction: Automate the downloading of New York Taxi Trip data CSV files for the year 2019.
Data Processing: Clean and process the data to derive analytical insights, such as trip durations, average fares, and passenger counts.
Data Loading: Load the processed data into a data warehouse for further querying and analysis.
Data Analysis: Perform queries and visualizations to gain insights from the processed data.

## Environment Setup
We need to ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed. 
We also need to installed required libraries.
Also we ned to have SQLite setup

## Step-by-step instructions :
1. We need to download the dataset from 
https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet

or we can download any file from this location.

2. Then we need to process the data where we need to clear, transform the data using Python, and Pandas.

3. Then we need to load the processed data into SQLite database.

4. After that we need to generate insights and report from this data.
